# GATEMATE

## Abstract
  GateMate is centered around the collection, organization, and presentation of flight
data obtained through the AvitionStack API. It addresses the high-level business problem
of simplifying and enriching the airport experience for travelers. It achieves this by offering a
comprehensive solution for gathering, organizing, and presenting real-time flight data.
Travelers often face challenges in navigating through airports, keeping track of gate
changes, and staying informed about the status of their flights. This application resolves
these challenges by enabling users to scan their boarding passes or manually search for
their flight, after which they receive up-to-the-minute notifications and directions, ensuring
they are always in the right place at the right time.

  While several flight-tracking applications exist, our system differentiates itself by
focusing on the integration of multiple services, combining AviationStack API data with
user-friendly functionalities. Our application is designed to be more than just a flight
tracker; it's a travel companion that offers an intelligent, context-aware experience for
travelers.
